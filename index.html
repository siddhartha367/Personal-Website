      <h4>Values of my Life</h4>
      <h2>My Journey: <span>School & Sports</span></h2>
      <p>Growing up at Bhavans Munshi Vidyashram, I learned the importance of friendship, discipline, and teamwork both
        in the classroom and on the field. From a young age, sports played a central role in my life, and I represented
        my school in various competitions, honing my skills in badminton, kho-kho, high jump, and long jump. These
        experiences taught me valuable lessons in leadership, agility, strategy, and the importance of working together
        toward common goals.
        <br><br>
        I proudly represented the Kerala Kho-Kho team, competing at national and state levels, and securing district and
        cluster championships three times. My achievements also include being a district winner in Karate Kata. These
        successes fueled my passion for sports, pushing me to constantly set new goals.
        <br><br>
        Alongside my sports journey, the support from my teachers and friends at school helped shape my core values,
        including resilience, problem-solving, and a deep sense of family. Today, as I focus on building my college
        Kho-Kho team, I continue to apply these principles of leadership and strategy, with the ultimate goal of
        becoming the MG University champion and beyond. To me, sports are not just about competition—they’re about
        growth, fun, and fostering a strong sense of community.
